/**
 * Your goal is to look through the list of students. 
 * - If a student has graduated, then your function should output a string literal informing you that the student has graduated and their diploma has been sent to their email. 
 * - If they havenâ€™t, the function should output a string literal informing you that the student has not graduated and no diploma will be sent.
 * 
 * Output: Regardless of the outcome, all string literals should be pushed in the array which the function will return at the end.
